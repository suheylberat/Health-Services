# Health-Services
Hello everyone,
If you are reading this, I have to tell you that this project is not finished yet. I know there are a lot of bugs in the code, but I'm just trying something different and I will keep improving and adding new things.
In the meantime, you can help me if you want. I'm not a professional in programming and I want to do the best I can. 
I'm using Beautiful Soap to access the UK National Health Service, and then I want to make a system where you can find out any details about any medicine, and if you have an emergency, you can see the five nearest hospitals to your location and details about those hospitals. 

My goal with this project is to collect all the emergencies and medicines you are curious about. Then I want to visualise it, and through this visualisation I want to make different kinds of inferences, for example, learning about emergencies in certain months of the year.

Thanks for reading this. If you have any advice, you can reach me by mail
